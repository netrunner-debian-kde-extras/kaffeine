kaffeine (0.7.1-1.3) unstable; urgency=low

  * NMU with maintainer's approval. All changes come straight from a patch
    sent by Modestas Vainius <geromanas@mailas.com> to the BTS. Thanks!

  * Remove 13_xine_service_menu.diff, since it breaks loading of
    libkaffeinepart (the name "Kaffeine" is hardcored in many places in the
    code, so leave it). Closes: #328738

  * Make kaffeine depend on kaffeine-xine | kaffeine-gstreamer instead of
    backwards, so that the XINE engine (the only one it used to exist) gets
    installed by default when upgrading from << 0.7 versions.

  * Update 12_gstreamer_service_menu.diff to leave "Name" section unchanged;
    no need to risk breaking things (like the bug above) in the future. Leave
    "Icon" unchanged as well.

kaffeine (0.7.1-1.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Non-maintainer upload.

  * Make Kaffeine not crash at exist. For this, don't call ./configure with
    --with-xorg and --with-xinit-workaround. Kudos to Christopher Martin for
    diagnosing the issue. Closes: #329010, #329143

  * Make Kaffeine not display the configuration wizard every time it starts.
    For this, remove bogus patch kubuntu_04_locate_wizard_stamp.diff (bug:
    even if locate() is used to check for system-wide configuration files, the
    file to write must be obtained with locateLocal()). Closes: #329177

kaffeine (0.7-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * Removed code that moved the menu file, as dh_installmenu does it now.
  * Removed patches that were included upstream.
  * Updated patches that weren't.
  * Moved 14_resume-playback.diff into old_patches/ - i.e. dropped it
    (hopefully temporarily).
  * Add DVB and GStreamer Build-Depends.
  * Split playing engines into kaffeine-gstreamer and kaffeine-xine.
  * Added Recommends and Suggests for several GStreamer plugins.
  * Updated package description.
  * Added 12_gstreamer_service_menu.diff, based on Kubuntu's patch
    kubuntu_02_gstreamer_service_menu.diff to change name, icon and MIME types
  	of the GStreamer part.
  * Added 13_xine_service_menu.diff to change name of the xine part.
  * Added kubuntu_03_gstreamer_stop.diff from Kubuntu to not attempt to play
    the logo file when the stop button is pressed.
  * Added 16_xine_stop.diff to not attempt to play the logo file when the stop
    button is pressed.
  * Re-added the logo files.
  * Added dbg-packages.diff to source package in case users want to build -dbg
    packages. They haven't helped me fix the bug I was trying to fix (the
    100% CPU on exit bug), so I'm not shipping them at this time.
  * Added a README to explain how to build the -dbg packages, and to note a
    workaround for the 100%-CPU bug.
  * Removed notes about kaffeine-dev from kaffeine.TODO, since they were
    out-of-date and really just unnecessary.
