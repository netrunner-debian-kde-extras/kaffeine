kaffeine (0.7.1-1.3) unstable; urgency=low

  * NMU with maintainer's approval. All changes come straight from a patch
    sent by Modestas Vainius <geromanas@mailas.com> to the BTS. Thanks!

  * Remove 13_xine_service_menu.diff, since it breaks loading of
    libkaffeinepart (the name "Kaffeine" is hardcored in many places in the
    code, so leave it). Closes: #328738

  * Make kaffeine depend on kaffeine-xine | kaffeine-gstreamer instead of
    backwards, so that the XINE engine (the only one it used to exist) gets
    installed by default when upgrading from << 0.7 versions.

  * Update 12_gstreamer_service_menu.diff to leave "Name" section unchanged;
    no need to risk breaking things (like the bug above) in the future. Leave
    "Icon" unchanged as well.

  * Make Kaffeine not display the configuration wizard every time it starts.
    For this, remove bogus patch kubuntu_04_locate_wizard_stamp.diff (bug:
    even if locate() is used to check for system-wide configuration files, the
    file to write must be obtained with locateLocal()). Closes: #329177

  * Added 13_xine_service_menu.diff to change name of the xine part.
  * Added kubuntu_03_gstreamer_stop.diff from Kubuntu to not attempt to play
    the logo file when the stop button is pressed.

    button is pressed.

  * Added a README to explain how to build the -dbg packages, and to note a
    workaround for the 100%-CPU bug.
